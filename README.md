# eighth-wanderer
This app was made using IMT App Inventor. We used it to make an app to buy tickets (classified in 3 different classes: First/ Tourist/ Economy) to travel on the Trans-Neptunian Spaceway, departuring from Earth into what will be our Spaceport: The Moon and then directly to Neptune.
